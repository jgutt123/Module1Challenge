# A Deep Dive Into Amberdata: The Leader In Digital Assets Market Data and Insights

## Overview and Origin

Amberdata, was founded on August 2017 by Shawn Douglass and Tong Tong Gong in Palo Alto California.

The inspiration for Amberdata came about during the ICO hype in 2017 after they realized there is not enough data and tooling to enable access to clean, normalized, easy-to-ingest and understand data to help people in the digital asset place. Amberdata, a series B startup has found great success in acquiring investors (currently 19) with over $47 million in funding.

## Business Activities

Building and maintaining massive data infrastructure and extracting and processing the data to create actionable information is extremely expensive and requires niche expertise. Amberdata seeks to help investment institutions in getting the fundamentals, market structural insights and signals to inform and catalyze decisions on cryptos and other digital assets. 

Amberdata’s intended customer is financial institutions which amount to a total market value of nearly $26 Trillion. Companies such as Citi, Coinbase, Binance, and Franklin Templeton all trust Amberdata for its products and services.

Some of Amberdata’s main competitors are Kaiko Data, and CoinMetrics. Although CoinMetrics provides cryptocurrency asset market and network data, Amberdata offers far more granular, indexed, time series on data than CoinMetrics. Kaiko on the other hand doesn’t provide blockchain (on-chain data), making Amberdata the leader in Digital assets market data and insights. Amberdata currently holds its servers on AWS and uses Amazon CloudFront to deliver content and data to its APIs.

## Landscape

Blockchain and cryptocurrencies have been around for years and now more than ever companies all across the world are looking for ways to integrate blockchain technology into their business. Amberdata, Coin Metrics, and Kaiko being in the Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies domain, have experienced the adoption of digital assets by major financial institutions and banks. Blackrock as well as other major players like WisdomTree and Invesco have introduced Bitcoin ETFs, which is a sign of confidence in decentralized finance. 

The increased use and popularity of digital assets and blockchain has inspired a new wave of technologies and innovations such as the Metaverse and AI-powered blockchain systems which will transform the future of business and finance.

## Results

Amberdata received a $330 Million valuation in 2022, and has had a major business impact offering data on over 100 exchanges and 12 blockchains. Nasdaq investment fund currently holds a percentage ownership of the company. Because it is a privately held company there is not a lot of visibility on its financials but they have been successful at raising funds. 

“Amberdata uses recurring revenue, renewals, new business and number of API calls as core metrics to measure success. They perform better during bull markets when cryptocurrencies are hot and there’s a lot of demand for data on digital assets.”(1)

Amberdata’s main competitors Kaiko and Coin Metrics have raised $82.5 Million and $58 Million respectively, Both privately held companies going through rounds of funding. 

## Recommendations

Amberdata currently provides raw on-chain data using rest protocol and API calls, so if I had to advise them on new products or services they should offer I would recommend intelligent market analytics and a user interface for charts and modeling. I believe this would benefit the company because it would improve the user experience and become more accessible to consumers. 

Integrating my recommendation would utilize technology such as data storage and management databases like SQL or NoSQL, and HTML, CSS, JavaScript to create an interactive and responsive interface. Overall, these technologies are appropriate for my solutions because they allow for a sophisticated and user-centric solution.
